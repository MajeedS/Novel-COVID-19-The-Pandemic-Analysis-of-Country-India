# Novel-COVID-19-The-Pandemic-Analysis-of-Country-India
The corona virus has affected almost the whole world since its first case found in China in late 2019. The world health organization (WHO) has given the name Covid-19 for coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that has been spreading all over the world and now it has become global pandemic. The COVID-19 has not only sickened millions of people around the world but shut down major cities in most of the countries. The COVID-19 has affected almost every person around the world and it has spread panic, mental stress and fear in all groups of people. India is also not untouched from COVID-19 and trying hard for controlling the virus outbreak and taking strict measures this study presents the current situation of COVID-19 spread in India along with its impact and various measures taken for it. In India, the disease was first detected on 30 January 2020 in Kerala in a student who returned from Wuhan. The total number of confirmed infected people is 67, 57,131 till now across India (07th October 2020).Most of the research and newspaper articles focus on the number of infected people in entire India. However, given the size and diversity of India, it may be a good idea to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, along with the entire country. For example, currently, Maharashtra has more than    14, 50,000 Confirmed infected cases, whereas Kerala has less than 2, 25, 000 Confirmed infected cases (till 07th October 2020).
